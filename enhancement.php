 <p id="paragraph1"> <strong> TJ's Enhancement </strong ><br> TJ's application page has a GIF in its background, and the links on the header light up orange. Click here to download the code. The way TJ was able to add a GIF as a background image for the application page <br> was to write "{background-image: url('TJ's GIF'); repeat: repeat;}". This code would allow TJ to add a GIF as a background for the application page.

<p id="paragraph2"> <strong> Kai Enhancements </strong> <br> Throughout this group project, Kai worked on the job description page for our company website. On the job description page, the apply button lights up white when hovering over it. Kai achieved this by adding a CSS selector ":hover", which allows the button to glow.

<p id="paragraph3"> <strong> Dimitrios Enhancements</strong ><br> Dimitrios focused on the home page of the website, which has multiple CSS enhancements that improve the user experience. One example is the navbar links changing color when hovered over. A GIF was also added to make the website more user-friendly and appealing. This goes beyond the basic requirements of the assignment and enhances the user experience while demonstrating a great understanding of CSS.
